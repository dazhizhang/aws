How to resolve "The maximum number of addresses has been reached" for AWS VPC Elastic IP addresses?

I'm working with AWS CDK and Kubernetes and I had to request a quota increase from 5 to 10, and I got it approved in 15 minutes.

Go to https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/ec2/quotas and search for "IP". Then, choose "EC2-VPC Elastic IPs".
